# LLMCostsLoggingClasses
This repo contains the source code for the PHP class you might need to log into llmcosts.fyi

We wouldn't normally expect you to need to install from source, and this code is typically very simple

You need an API key from llmcosts.fyi. Instructions for use of this class, pre-populated with that API key, are available on that site.
